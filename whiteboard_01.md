# **Actual**
given an array of integers  
remove the duplicates  
return the final resulting array  

let arr = [1, 1 ,2 ,3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5];   


//declare a variable with an empty array [] 
//Iterate through the array (for loop)  
//using an array method...remove the duplicates  
//while iterating, within an if statement (inside of for loop)  
    //keep track of current index  
    //keep track of the index following index  
    //!==  

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# **Feedback**

## Improve
- Don't make any assumptions (ASK QUESTIONS)
    - "am I provided with an array to begin with, or should I construct my own?"
    - "will the integers be in order?"
    - "does the array contain any negative numbers?"
    - "will any of the integers be strings ([one, two, three])"?
- SLOW DOWN
    - think of multiple use cases
- Work out the solution in procedural pseudocode
    - START
        - INIT
        - READ
        - Etc...


## Sustain
- compared my solution against previous example (morning kata)
- worked out solution, explaining the process
